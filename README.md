## 1.Introduction

 "BlackMirror: Bandersnatch", which is the Netflix original movie, inspired me to create an imitation. This program is controlled by our choice like the movie.You can seek to endings in the program. In the program, 4-endings are existed. Actually, you can find all of them easily. Finally, this report have had two versions about program code. Firstcode is easy to make me coding easily. But that’s not concerning about the program’s view and has a lot of overheading. Second code is opposition. It is easy to draw a diagram and more  programfully. So I will introduce the process making this JAVA program.



## 2.Diagrams

* That is the class diagram of first program. It doesn’t have any association among classes, and even these are all pubic classes.

* So I minimalize the diagram newly. That is the class diagram of second program. It is more simple than the first. Below, Start Class have "Main" which use Set_Font Class. But, it doesn’t help us to understand it well.Other diagrams can explain the process of the program.
